# Assignment 1 for MVE162
Suggested discussion questions:

1. Describe all qualitatively di§erent solutions to the equation (1) without solv-
ing the equation analytically and give a biologic interpretation of your math-
ematical conclusions.
2. Illustrate your theoretical conclusions about solutions to (1) by graphs of rep-
resentative curves for di§erent initial data.
3. Find formulas for all nullclines of the system (2) that are lines where x0
1 = 0
or x0
2 = 0. Find all biologically relevant stationary (equilibrium) points (they
are intersections of nullclines).
4. Describe geometrically all possible qualitatively di§erent relative positions of
nullclines and equilibrium points (there are four non-trivial distinct cases).
Sketch pictures illustrating each case with nullclines marked by di§erent colors.
Give a biologic interpretation of all possible equilibrium points.
5. Prove that solutions to the system (2) with positive initial data x1(0) > 0,
x2(0) > 0 must have strictly positive components x1(t) > 0, x2(t) > 0 for
arbitrary time t > 0.
6. Characterize all combinations of parameters r1
1 , K1 and r2
2 , K2 and positions
of nullclines that correspond to sustainable coexistence of both species. One
can do it by applying the Grobman-Hartman theorem and the criteria for
classiÖcation of phase portraits around equilibrium points for linear systems.
One can also give an elementary geometric proof using properties of nullclines.
7. Draw pictures with phase portraits together with nullclines illustrating your
conclusions.
8. What is qualitative di§erence between the behavior of solutions to the logistic
equation and to the two species competition model when t ! 1 ? How this
di§erence depends on 1 and 2 ?
